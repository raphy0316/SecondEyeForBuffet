## Project Initiation:<br>
 The project "Second Eye for Buffet" originated from observing a visually impaired student struggling to attend a friend's birthday party. Witnessing her distress, the project was initiated with the aim of providing assistance and making buffet experiences more accessible for visually impaired individuals.

## Significance:<br>
 Participating in events such as weddings and birthdays held in buffet settings is challenging for visually impaired individuals, hindering their social activities. Recognizing this, the project seeks to enable visually impaired individuals to independently navigate and enjoy buffet experiences, aligning with cultural practices in various countries, including Korea.

## Project Objectives:<br>
 The core of this system is to facilitate independent and unobtrusive buffet experiences for visually impaired individuals. Additionally, incorporating features that benefit buffet operators is crucial for convincing them to adopt the system.

## Project Components:<br>
1, Server<br>
2, App<br>
3, RFID<br>

## Key Features:<br>
 The system distinguishes between seller and user modes. When a blind user approaches, the seller's RFID chip information is retrieved from the server. Information includes food names, allergy details, and descriptions. Chips designated as obstacles provide collision risk alerts. Users can touch the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the phone screen to select the desired information. The user interface is simplified for accessibility.

## Future Additions:<br>
### 1, Indoor Navigation for Visually Impaired:<br>
Enables visually impaired individuals to navigate indoors.<br>
### 2, Chair Robot for Accurate Guidance:<br>
Develops a chair robot for precise navigation during movement.<br>
### 3, Automated Buffet Refills and Statistical Insights:<br>
Utilizes the chair robot, indoor navigation, and database systems to automate buffet refills and provide statistics related to food consumption.<br>
Note: Currently, the server is not operational, and detailed execution cannot be demonstrated. However, you can explore the app's functionality by installing the appfile-app.apk.
